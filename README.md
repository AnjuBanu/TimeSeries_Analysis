## TimeSeries_Analysis

Time series data, as the name indicates, differ from other types of data in the sense that the temporal aspect is an important area of machine learning and is often neglected. On a positive note, this gives us additional information that can be used when building our machine learning model, that not only the input features contain useful information, but also the changes in input/output over time. However, while the time component adds additional information, it also makes time series problems more difficult to handle compared to many other prediction tasks.

Analysts can tell the difference between random fluctuations or outliers, and can separate genuine insights from seasonal variations. Time series analysis shows how data changes over time, and good forecasting can identify the direction in which the data is changing.
